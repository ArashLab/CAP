# CAP Architecture


Think of the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) that is used in the cloud environment. You describe the infrastructure in a file (i.e. YAML or JSON). Your cloud provider makes sure the infrastructure is available for you. CAP uses the same concept to provide genomic analysis at scale. You write the specification of the analysis and then CAP executes the analysis.
